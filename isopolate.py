    The algorithms used in this function very closely match those used in the C++ program Intertec.
    
    If *interpolate* is a single number then features are interpolated at regularly spaced intervals
    of *interpolate* radians between input features. Most of these interpolated features are isochrons
    with the boundaries being continental-oceanic boundaries (COB).
    
    If *interpolate* is a sequence of numbers then features are interpolated at geological times
    specified by these numbers. All of these interpolated features will be isochrons.
